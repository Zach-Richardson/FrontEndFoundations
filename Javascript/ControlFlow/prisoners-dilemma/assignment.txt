SUMMARY
XYZ T-Shirt Co is in a heated competition with its competitor, ABC Apparel.
XYZ T-Shirt Co has hired your consulting firm to advise them on their pricing strategy.

They have asked your firm to architect an algorithmic approach to pricing one of their 
t-shirt lines. ABC Apparel sells a very similar - almost identical - t-shirt line. 
XYZ has determined that if they price their shirts at $50 and ABC Apparel prices their 
shirts at $50, both companies will sell approximately 200 shirts per day. 

If XYZ cuts their price to $40 per shirt but ABC keeps their price at $50, XYZ expects 
to maintain their volume of 200 shirts per day but slash ABC's volume to 120 shirts 
per day. Both brand's customers are loyal, but even loyal customers won't buy when 
they see competitors offering a deal.

If XYZ keeps their price of $50 per shirt, but ABC cuts their price to $40 per shirt,
then ABC will continue to sell 200 shirts per day but XYZ will see a decline to 120 
shirts per day.

If XYZ cuts their price to $40 per shirt and ABC also cuts their price to $40 per shirt,
both companies will maintain their current sales volume of 200 shirts per day.
